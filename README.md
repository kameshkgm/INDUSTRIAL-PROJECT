# ABOUT THE PROJECT
This project is basically a machine health monitoring system it monitors the health of the machine(ie motor) and if any abnormality is found it will send an alert message to the manager through whatsapp you and can add n no of motors in this app and monitor their health .
# HOW THE PORJECT WORKS
For this project i have used esp32 combined with 4 sensors that monitor the speed, temperature, vibration , current and i will post this data to an EMQX server where an MQTT is subscribed to an topic mqtt recieves those data as json packet and these data will recieved by the front end and display it in graphica manner and if any anomalies are found it will send the alert message through twilio to the subscribed whatsapp number and i have also implemented a  logic to store this logic in a mongodb database.
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
